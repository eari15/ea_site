I am a political scientist specializing in international relations with expertise in conflict studies, currently serving as a Research Associate and Adjunct Instructor in <a href="https://sgpp.arizona.edu/" target="_blank">the School of Government and Public Policy at the University of Arizona</a>.

My research agenda encompasses two complementary streams that examine critical questions about the complex dynamics of political violence and the broader implications of states of emergency for international conflict and cooperation. Through this research, published in venues including the <i>Journal of Peace Research</i> and <i>Terrorism and Political Violence</i>, I employ an interdisciplinary approach that combines quantitative analysis of original datasets with experimental designs to provide fresh insights into well-established questions in conflict research.

As an educator, I am committed to bridging theory and practice in the classroom through innovative pedagogical approaches. My teaching methodology centers on creating weekly contentious questions that require students to engage with real-world scenarios, complemented by simulations that mirror the ethical issues in policy making and diplomatic challenges of conflict resolution. I have designed and taught courses on international relations, international conflict and security, political violence, terrorism and counterterrorism, foreign policy analysis, and research methods.
