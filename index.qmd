I am a Research Associate and an Adjunct Instructor in <a href="https://policylab.arizona.edu" target="_blank">the School of Government and Public Policy at the University of Arizona</a>.

My research agenda covers civil conflict, political violence, terrorism, state of emergency, and electoral behavior utilizing originally collected data at various levels (individual survey respondents, non-state armed groups, and countries) and quantified textual and visual data such as newspapers and satellite imagery.

I teach courses on international relations, peace and conflict, terrorism and counter-terrorism, foreign policy analysis, and research methods.
