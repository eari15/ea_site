    "text": "Even though violent attacks resulting in civilian fatalities can be seen as constituting failure on the part of the incumbent party to provide security to citizens, governments are not always punished electorally. Rather, at times, they appear to gain votes following terrorist attacks. Here we argue that political parties that can take advantage of their local presence to frame and communicate their narrative in response to terrorism, can better manage to avoid blame and even to emerge victorious in times of violent conflict. The AKP in Turkey is one such important example. Our statistical analyses of municipality-level aggregate election results show that the party not only maintained national incumbency, but even strengthened its predominance in the political system in the face of growing security threats. In municipalities where AKP controlled the local government and hence municipal resources, the party did not lose votes following terrorist attacks. This finding remains even when we consider past voting, regional variations, competitive districts, and ethnicity. Our argument that incumbents can avoid punishment through their capacity to reach out to voters at the local level is also supported by individual-level survey data and the comparison with neighboring municipalities. As such, we highlight how local government control can be consequential for national politics, including periods when security dominates the national agenda."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Although banks occupy a central role in most (post-)conflict situations, there is a perplexing lack of attention to them in studies of political violence. As a case experiencing domestic conflict with varying degrees in the last decades, Turkey offers opportunities to understand how the banking sector, including state deposit banks, responds to such political violence. We focus on the short-term impact of political violence and address the following questions: Do all actors in the sector respond in similar ways to security threats? Is there variation according to conflict intensity? We shed light on these puzzles with an analysis of original data on bank ownership, bank branches, bank deposit amounts, and bank credits. We show that banks with profit incentives respond to conflict by lowering their presence in provinces hit by these attacks. In comparison, our finding that deposits in high conflict intensity areas are not affected suggests that it is indeed economic actors outside high intensity regions that are more sensitive to short-time changes in security compared to local ones. Overall, the results demonstrate that political violence hurts banks’ presence in conflict locations and their presence matters through credit provision to these areas."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The relationship between different regime types and international conflict has been studied extensively, yet the role of emergency powers, which profoundly relate to both, remains understudied. While conventionally viewed as democratic institutional responses to crises, states of emergency are also frequently utilized by non-democratic regimes, underscoring these powers’ significance in interstate conflict processes across diverse political systems. Yet, there is scant focus on domestic, national emergencies in non-democratic regime types. The implicit assumption that the leadership of a given regime always faces the same internal constraints contributes to puzzling findings. We attempt to reconcile past findings by analyzing how such emergencies might influence international conflict and peace. Building on the long-standing discussion of audience costs, we argue that emergencies predispose conflict initiation risks in non-democratic regimes with accountability mechanisms. Our case studies and statistical analysis of all countries from the world (1980-2007) with multiple datasets demonstrate that party-led civilian non-democratic regimes tend to demonstrate higher rates of international conflicts compared to other non-democracies, when facing domestic emergencies. Our study suggests that internal emergencies considerably relate to foreign policy behavior and would end up harming international cooperation."

    "text": "The relationship between different regime types and international conflict has been studied extensively, yet the role of emergency powers, which profoundly relate to both, remains understudied. While conventionally viewed as democratic institutional responses to crises, states of emergency are also frequently utilized by non-democratic regimes, underscoring these powers’ significance in interstate conflict processes across diverse political systems. Yet, there is scant focus on domestic, national emergencies in non-democratic regime types. The implicit assumption that the leadership of a given regime always faces the same internal constraints contributes to puzzling findings. We attempt to reconcile past findings by analyzing how such emergencies might influence international conflict and peace. Building on the long-standing discussion of audience costs, we argue that emergencies predispose conflict initiation risks in non-democratic regimes with accountability mechanisms. Our case studies and statistical analysis of all countries from the world (1980-2007) with multiple datasets demonstrate that party-led civilian non-democratic regimes tend to demonstrate higher rates of international conflicts compared to other non-democracies, when facing domestic emergencies. Our study suggests that internal emergencies considerably relate to foreign policy behavior and would end up harming international cooperation."
